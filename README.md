Breast Cancer Classification with Neural Networks
This project implements a Breast Cancer Classification model using Neural Networks (NN). The goal is to accurately classify tumors as either malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous) based on a dataset of cell characteristics. The model leverages the power of deep learning to identify complex patterns and relationships within the data, leading to a robust and reliable classification system.

üíª Project Description
This project provides a comprehensive solution for breast cancer diagnosis using a feed-forward neural network. It includes data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. The NN is trained on a public dataset to predict the diagnosis with high accuracy, serving as a powerful tool for early detection and medical analysis.

üíæ Dataset
The model is trained on the Wisconsin Breast Cancer (Diagnostic) Dataset, which contains 569 instances of breast cancer samples. Each instance includes 30 numerical features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. The dataset is widely used for machine learning classification tasks due to its well-defined features and binary classification problem.

üìä Features
The dataset includes 30 features that describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the images. These features are:

Radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)

Texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)

Perimeter

Area

Smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)

Compactness (perimeter squared / area - 1.0)

Concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)

Concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)

Symmetry

Fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)

For each of these 10 core features, there are three values: the mean, standard error, and "worst" or largest (mean of the three largest values) of these features, resulting in 30 total features.

üß† Model Architecture
The neural network is a simple feed-forward model with multiple layers. The architecture consists of:

Input Layer: 30 neurons, corresponding to the 30 features of the dataset.

Hidden Layers: One or more fully connected dense layers with ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation functions to introduce non-linearity.

Output Layer: A single neuron with a sigmoid activation function, which outputs a probability value between 0 and 1. A value close to 0 indicates a benign tumor, while a value close to 1 indicates a malignant tumor.

The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer and the binary cross-entropy loss function, which is ideal for binary classification problems.

‚úÖ Results
The model achieves a high classification accuracy and precision on the test set. Key metrics include:

Accuracy: > 95%

Precision: > 95%

Recall: > 95%

F1-Score: > 95%

These results demonstrate the model's effectiveness in distinguishing between benign and malignant tumors. A confusion matrix is also provided to visualize the number of true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative predictions.
